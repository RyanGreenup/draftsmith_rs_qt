# Implementing Command Palette

The command palette provides a quick way to access menu actions through a searchable popup interface. This document explains how the command palette was implemented and integrated into the application.

## Overview

The command palette is triggered by pressing Ctrl+P and shows a searchable list of all available menu actions. The implementation follows this flow:

1. User presses Ctrl+P
2. Command palette popup appears
3. User can type to filter actions
4. Selected action executes when Enter is pressed

## Implementation Details

### Command Palette Class

The `CommandPalette` class (in `widgets/command_palette.py`) inherits from `PopupPalette` and handles:

1. Collecting actions from menus
2. Filtering actions based on search
3. Displaying actions with descriptions
4. Executing selected actions

### Action Collection

When the palette opens, it recursively collects all actions from the application's menubar:

```python
def populate_actions(self, menubar: QMenuBar) -> None:
    self._actions.clear()
    for menu in menubar.findChildren(QMenu):
        self._collect_actions_from_menu(menu)
```

The collection process:
1. Traverses all menus and submenus
2. Stores enabled actions with text
3. Skips separators and disabled items

### Search and Filtering

The palette implements real-time filtering:

1. User input is split into search terms
2. Actions are filtered if they contain all search terms
3. Results update as you type
4. Matching is case-insensitive

### Action Display

Each action is displayed with:
- Action name (menu item text)
- Status tip (description)
- Visual separator between name and description

### Action Execution

When an action is selected:
1. The action's `trigger()` method is called
2. Status bar is updated
3. Palette closes automatically

## Integration

The command palette is integrated into the main window:

1. Created when main window initializes
2. Bound to Ctrl+P shortcut
3. Accesses main window's menubar for actions
4. Updates status bar with action descriptions

## Usage

To use the command palette:

1. Press Ctrl+P to open
2. Type to filter actions
3. Use arrow keys to select
4. Press Enter to execute
5. Press Esc to cancel

The command palette provides a keyboard-centric way to access any menu action quickly without navigating through menus.
