# Development Log

## feat: Implement NotesModel and update MainContent to use dynamic note loading `fd6dd4e`

### Changes Made

1. Created initial API client structure in `api/client.py`
   - Implemented comprehensive API client classes (NoteAPI, TagAPI, TaskAPI, AssetAPI)
   - Used Pydantic models for type-safe data handling
   - Example:
   ```python
   class NoteAPI(API):
       def get_note(self, note_id: int) -> Note:
           response = requests.get(f"{self.base_url}/notes/flat/{note_id}")
           return Note.model_validate(response.json())
   ```

2. Established base models for data structures
   - Created Note model with relationship support (tags, hierarchy, links)
   - Added support for backlinks and forward links
   - Example structure:
   ```python
   @dataclass
   class Note:
       id: int
       title: str
       content: str
       created_at: datetime
       modified_at: datetime
   ```

### Motivation

The changes were driven by the need to:
1. Have a clean separation between API communication and business logic
2. Support complex note relationships (hierarchy, tags, backlinks)
3. Ensure type safety using Pydantic models
4. Prepare for Model-View architecture implementation

### Next Steps

1. Implement NotesModel class to manage data and API interactions
2. Update UI components to use the model instead of dummy data
3. Add proper error handling for API calls
4. Implement data refresh mechanisms
