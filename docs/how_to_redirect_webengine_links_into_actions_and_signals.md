# How to Redirect WebEngine Links into Actions and Signals

This tutorial explains how to handle custom links in a Qt WebEngine view, specifically in the context of a markdown note-taking application. We'll show how to intercept link clicks and convert them into application actions.

## The Problem

In a markdown note-taking app, you often want links between notes. For example, a link like `[See related note](/note/42)` should open note #42 when clicked, rather than trying to navigate to a web URL.

## The Solution

Qt's WebEngine provides a way to intercept navigation requests through the `QWebEnginePage.acceptNavigationRequest` method. By subclassing `QWebEnginePage`, we can catch link clicks and convert them into application actions.

## Implementation

### 1. Create a Custom Page Handler

First, create a subclass of `QWebEnginePage` that will handle the navigation requests:

```python
from PySide6.QtWebEngineCore import QWebEnginePage

class LinkHandler(QWebEnginePage):
    def __init__(self, markdown_editor):
        super().__init__(markdown_editor)  # Set parent
        self.markdown_editor = markdown_editor  # Store reference to editor

    def acceptNavigationRequest(self, url, _type, isMainFrame):
        path = url.path()
        if path.startswith('/note/'):
            try:
                note_id = int(path[6:])  # Extract note ID
                self.markdown_editor.note_selected.emit(note_id)
                return False  # Prevent actual navigation
            except ValueError:
                pass
        return True  # Allow other navigation
```

### 2. Set Up the WebEngine View

In your markdown editor widget, set up the WebEngine view with the custom page handler:

```python
from PySide6.QtWebEngineWidgets import QWebEngineView

class MarkdownEditor(QWidget):
    note_selected = Signal(int)  # Signal for note selection

    def __init__(self, parent=None):
        super().__init__(parent)
        
        # Create preview with custom link handling
        self.preview = QWebEngineView()
        self.preview.setPage(LinkHandler(self))
```

### 3. Set the Base URL

When setting HTML content in the preview, specify a base URL to ensure relative links work correctly:

```python
from PySide6.QtCore import QUrl

def set_preview_content(self, html: str):
    self.preview.setHtml(html, QUrl("note://local/"))
```

## How It Works

1. When a user clicks a link in the preview pane, Qt WebEngine calls `acceptNavigationRequest`
2. Our handler checks if the URL matches our expected format (e.g., `/note/42`)
3. If it matches:
   - Extract the note ID
   - Emit a signal with the ID
   - Return `False` to prevent actual navigation
4. If it doesn't match:
   - Return `True` to allow normal navigation

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Links Not Being Intercepted

If your links aren't being intercepted, check:
- The base URL is set correctly when calling `setHtml()`
- The link format matches what your handler expects
- The `LinkHandler` is properly connected to your preview widget

### Wrong Signal Connections

Make sure:
- Your editor widget defines the necessary signals
- The `LinkHandler` has a proper reference to the widget that owns the signals
- Signal connections are made before trying to use them

## Example Usage

Here's how the complete flow works in a note-taking application:

1. User writes markdown with a link: `[See note](/note/42)`
2. Markdown is rendered to HTML: `<a href="/note/42">See note</a>`
3. User clicks the link in the preview
4. `acceptNavigationRequest` catches the click
5. Handler emits `note_selected` signal with ID 42
6. Application receives signal and loads note #42

## Best Practices

1. Always validate input before converting to integers or other types
2. Use clear signal names that describe the action
3. Keep the handler focused on navigation logic only
4. Document expected URL formats
5. Consider adding logging for debugging

## Conclusion

This pattern allows you to seamlessly integrate web-style navigation into your desktop application while maintaining full control over the navigation behavior. It's particularly useful for markdown editors, documentation viewers, and other applications that combine web-style content with desktop application features.
